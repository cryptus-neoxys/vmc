        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>When we started way back in 1991, we never looked back. In 1998 we sent our first batch of class X to appear
            for CBSE board examination and had 100% pass result. Naturally we were happy. Subsequent years also saw 100%
            result but the difference was, we were not anymore satisfied with 100% pass result. We set higher goals for
            ourselves and said why not enable all students to pass in 1st division! Today, our goal is higher still-
            everybody in distinction!
            <br><br>
            It is not only academic activities; the school has been flying high. Our students have etched their team's
            name on the map of Gujarat in basketball and chess. Our quizzers dazzle in all quiz programs. One of our
            students was selected to attend G-8 international conference on global warming.
        </p>
        <h4>Vision</h4>
        <p>We will provide a strong technological orientation across the whole curriculum which maximises individual
            potential and ensures that students of all ability levels are equipped to meet the challenges of education,
            work and life.</p>
        <h4>Mission</h4>
        <p>Ramakrishna Matriculation School strives to provide a plethora of learning experiences which enrich the lives
            of students making them better individuals and responsible citizens committed to the ideals of equality and
            justice and inculcate in them a sense of patriotism and universal brotherhood.</p>
