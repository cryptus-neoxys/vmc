      achieving the best civic standards in the country, preserve the historical character of the city and make it an
      attractive destination for tourists.</h3>
    <h3 class="vision">The VMC has twelve executive committees apart from the standing committee, which look after the specialized 
      functions of VMC. These committees include public works committee, water work committee, drainage and sewerage committee, 
      health committee, town planning committee, estate management committee, recreation and culture committee, electric committee, 
      and legal committee. Each committee consists of 12 councilors each. The formulation of an additional ward committee is

      <h3 class="project-1">In May 2016, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MOPNG), introduced the ‘Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana’ (PMUY) as a flagship scheme with an objective to make clean cooking fuel such as LPG available to the rural and deprived households which were otherwise using 
        traditional cooking fuels such as firewood, coal, cow-dung cakes etc. Usage of traditional cooking fuels had detrimental impacts on the health of rural women as well as on the environment.</h3>
      <h3 class="project-2">Taking inspiration from Mahatma Gandhi who spoke of developing villages in order to develop India, the Prime Minister has set a goal that by 2016, all parliamentarians must target to establish at least one Model village in his or her constituency,
         with the goal of improving the physical and institutional infrastructure in a holistic way that is centred on the village community.The target under the scheme was to release 8 Crore LPG Connections to the deprived households by March 2020</h3>
